# HypixelBot

##### HypixelBot is an automated proof of concept Minecraft bot to win games/coins for the popular Minecraft server, Hypixel. This bot is bannable for 'statistic boosting,' and I don't suggest you use it.

# Setup

#### This bot is writted in NodeJS, therefore you must have NodeJS installed to your computer to use it. You can download NodeJS [here](https://nodejs.org/en/).

#### To setup this bot, you need 11 alternate Minecraft accounts saved to a file called 'accounts.txt' in the same parent directory as the main 'HypixelBot.js' file. The format of the accounts.txt file is email:password followed by a new line with the 2nd account, continuing until you have all 11 alternate accounts ('alts') in the file. Once this is finished, you need to install node-minecraft-protocol, which is what the bot uses to connect to Hypixel. To install this module, open a command prompt window and type

    npm install node-minecraft-protocol

# Usage

##### To run the bot, type

    node HypixelBot.js

##### while in the same directory that 'HypixelBot.js' is in.
